# 🚔 Forking (please read)

I have put a lot of effort into this website, therefore I would like to let you know that you can use my code, but make it your own in some way. Plagerism is not nice! Also I would very much appreciate if you could link back to my website or give me credit in some way.

I like helping others but I do not like being copied.
