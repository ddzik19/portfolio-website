# Damian Dzik Portfolio website

This is my portfolio website where i showcase my work and development skills. This is my first React.js website. I saw many frontend developers having their own portfolio website so I decided I should have one too.

# 🚔 Forking (please read)

I have put a lot of effort into this website, therefore I would like to let you know that you can use my code, but make it your own in some way. Plagerism is not nice! Also I would very much appreciate if you could link back to my website or give me credit in some way.

I like helping others but I do not like being copied.
